# NIST PQC Standards: What You Need to Know

After an eight-year evaluation process, NIST published the first set of post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. Understanding these standards is crucial for anyone responsible for cryptographic security.

## The NIST PQC Competition

The selection process:
- **2016**: Competition announced
- **2017**: 69 initial submissions
- **2020**: 15 finalists selected
- **2022**: 4 algorithms chosen
- **2024**: Final standards published

## The Three Core Standards

### FIPS 203: Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM)

Previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, ML-KEM is designed for general encryption purposes.

**Security Levels:**
- **ML-KEM-512**: Roughly equivalent to AES-128 (~2^170 security)
- **ML-KEM-768**: Roughly equivalent to AES-192 (~2^233 security)
- **ML-KEM-1024**: Roughly equivalent to AES-256 (~2^298 security)

**Key Sizes:**
- Public key: 800-1568 bytes
- Private key: 1632-3168 bytes
- Ciphertext: 768-1568 bytes

**Best For:**
- TLS/SSL encryption
- VPN tunnels
- File encryption
- Secure messaging

### FIPS 204: Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA)

Previously known as CRYSTALS-Dilithium, ML-DSA provides quantum-safe digital signatures.

**Security Levels:**
- **ML-DSA-44**: Category 2 security (~2^134 security)
- **ML-DSA-65**: Category 3 security (~2^190 security)
- **ML-DSA-87**: Category 5 security (~2^272 security)

**Best For:**
- Code signing
- Document signing
- Certificate authority signatures
- Software updates
- Blockchain transactions

### FIPS 205: Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA)

Previously known as SPHINCS+, SLH-DSA provides conservative security based only on hash functions.

**Advantages:**
- Based solely on hash function security
- No mathematical assumptions
- Most conservative security

**Best For:**
- Long-term signatures (decades)
- Root certificate signing
- Firmware signing
- Critical infrastructure

## Implementation Guidelines

### Hybrid Schemes Recommended

NIST recommends combining classical and post-quantum algorithms during transition:

**For Encryption:**
Combined = Classical-KEM + ML-KEM
Example: RSA-2048 + ML-KEM-768

**For Signatures:**
Dual Signature = Classical-Sig + ML-DSA
Example: ECDSA-P256 + ML-DSA-65

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Use PQC-enabled libraries (liboqs, BouncyCastle)
2. Implement hybrid schemes
3. Test performance in your environment

### For Enterprises
1. Conduct cryptographic inventory
2. Assess migration timeline
3. Pilot PQC in non-critical systems

### For Decision Makers
1. Understand the quantum threat
2. Allocate budget for migration
3. Establish PQC policies

The NIST standards provide a solid foundation for the post-quantum era. Early adoption is key to staying ahead of the quantum threat.
