# Hardware vs Software PQC: Why Hardware Wins

Post-quantum cryptography can be implemented in software libraries or dedicated hardware. While software implementations are easier to deploy, hardware solutions offer significant advantages in performance, security, and reliability.

## Performance Comparison

### ML-KEM-768 Encryption
- **Software (CPU)**: 150-300μs per operation
- **Hardware (QuantumShield)**: 15-30μs per operation
- **Speedup**: 10x faster

### ML-DSA-65 Signing
- **Software (CPU)**: 500-1000μs per signature
- **Hardware**: 50-100μs per signature
- **Speedup**: 10x faster

### Throughput
- **Software**: ~3,000 ops/sec
- **Hardware**: ~30,000 ops/sec
- **Scalability**: Hardware better for high-volume applications

## Security Advantages

### Protected Key Storage
- Keys never leave secure hardware
- Resistant to memory dumps
- Protection against malware

### Side-Channel Resistance
- Hardware implementations resist timing attacks
- Power analysis protection
- Electromagnetic emission shielding

### Tamper Detection
- Physical security mechanisms
- Self-destruct on intrusion attempts
- Audit trails for all operations

## Use Cases

**Choose Hardware When:**
- High-volume operations required
- Maximum security needed
- Long-term key storage
- Compliance requirements (FIPS 140-3)

**Software May Suffice When:**
- Low-volume operations
- Rapid prototyping
- Budget constraints
- Temporary deployments

The future of secure cryptography is hardware-accelerated and quantum-safe.
