# Quantum Computing Timeline: When Should You Worry?

The question isn't "if" quantum computers will break current encryption, but "when." Industry experts and government agencies provide varying timelines, but the consensus is clear: the threat is real and approaching.

## Expert Predictions

### Near-Term (2025-2028)
- 100-1,000 qubit systems with improved error correction
- Threat to specialized cryptographic systems
- Demonstration of quantum advantage in specific applications

### Mid-Term (2028-2033)
- 10,000+ qubit fault-tolerant systems
- Realistic threat to RSA-2048 and ECC-256
- Major tech companies likely to achieve cryptographically relevant quantum computers

### Long-Term (2033+)
- Large-scale, error-corrected quantum computers
- Capability to break all current public-key cryptography
- Widespread availability of quantum computing resources

## The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" Problem

Adversaries are already collecting encrypted data with the intent to decrypt it once quantum computers become available. This means:

- **Medical records** - Privacy violations decades into the future
- **Financial data** - Long-term fraud and manipulation risks
- **Government secrets** - National security implications
- **Trade secrets** - Competitive advantage loss

## What Organizations Should Do Now

### Immediate Actions (2025)
1. **Inventory cryptographic assets** - Identify what needs protection
2. **Assess data sensitivity lifespan** - How long must data remain secure?
3. **Begin pilot projects** - Test post-quantum solutions in non-critical systems

### Short-Term (2025-2027)
1. **Deploy hybrid solutions** - Combine classical and quantum-safe algorithms
2. **Update security policies** - Include PQC requirements
3. **Train staff** - Educate teams on quantum threats and solutions

### Long-Term (2027+)
1. **Full migration** - Complete transition to post-quantum cryptography
2. **Continuous monitoring** - Stay updated on quantum computing advances
3. **Regular audits** - Ensure all systems remain quantum-safe

## Regulatory Landscape

Government mandates are emerging:

- **CERT-In**: Indian Computer Emergency Response Team recommending quantum-safe cryptography adoption
- **NTRO**: National Technical Research Organisation working on quantum-safe standards
- **Ministry of Electronics & IT**: Proposed quantum-safe requirements for critical infrastructure

Don't wait for regulations to force your hand. The time to act is now.
